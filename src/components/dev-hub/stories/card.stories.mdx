Cards do not need images and can handle short and long titles. You can configure
the max number of lines a title can have using the `maxTitleLines` prop.

    <Story name="no-image card">
        <div style={{ display: 'flex' }}>
            <Card
                width="300px"
                title="I'm a card with a really really really really really really really really really really long title"
                description="This card has a long title, displaying 2 lines by default."
                href="#cards"
            />
            <Card
                width="300px"
                title="I'm a card with a really really really really really really really really really really long title.I'm a card with a really really really really really really really really really really long title"
                maxTitleLines={4}
                description="This card has a long title, displaying 4 lines though the 'maxTitleLines' prop."
                href="#cards"
            />
            <Card
                highlight
                width="300px"
                title="I'm a card with a short title"
