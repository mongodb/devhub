# Article Series

An article series is an ordered list of articles where an article can have one of
three "positions": `past`, `active`, or `upcoming`.

* A `past` article is one that is before the `active` article in the series.
* An `active` article is the one the reader is looking at.
* An `upcoming` article is any article that follows after the `active` article in the 
series.
